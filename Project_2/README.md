# PROJECT #2: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Description: Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and structure, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
