# PROJECT #2: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and structure, then clean it. I document the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
