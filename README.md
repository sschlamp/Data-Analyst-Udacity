# Data-Analyst-Udacity
Projects as part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity

## PROJECT #1: Investigate a Dataset

Description:
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate
your findings about it. This includes asking questions, exploring
the dataset, performing basic data wrangling, drawing
conclusions, and presenting your findings with numbers and
visualizations. Your analysis will be performed in a Jupyter
Notebook using the NumPy and pandas Python libraries.

## PROJECT #2: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Description:
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its
libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a
variety of formats, assess its quality and structure, then clean it.
This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling
efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through
analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

## PROJECT #3: Communicate Data Findings

Description:
In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore your selected
dataset, starting with plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends,
and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be
through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
