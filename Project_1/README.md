# PROJECT #1: Investigate a Dataset

In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. This project included asking questions, exploring the dataset, performing basic data wrangling, drawing conclusions, and presenting the findings with numbers and visualizations. The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using the NumPy and pandas Python libraries.
