PROJECT #3: Communicate Data Findings
Description: In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore your selected dataset, starting with plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
