# PROJECT #3: Communicate Data Findings

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore the selected dataset, starting with plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying the findings was be through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
